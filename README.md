# Rust Exercism

[Exercism](https://exercism.org) is a platform for learning programming
languages. You solve code exercises to gain fluency. There is a track for the
Rust programming language.

This repository contains solutions to the Rust exercises as I complete them.
There are infinite ways of solving any exercise. Most of the time, the solutions
that you'll find in this repository are optimized by reading and gaining insight
from others' solutions after I've solved it myself.

If you're learning Rust, I recommend you sign up and try the exercises
yourself first before relying on these solutions.
